body: "Hi, thank you very much for this guide. It's really helpful.\r\nI just wonder what the command `ssh user@ceph-server` is all about. I didn't find anything concrete in the [ceph documentation](https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rados/deployment/preflight-checklist/#create-a-user). Should I connect it here to the admin node to create a ceph-user via ssh?"
