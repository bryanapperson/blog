body: "Is Lucy Liu the actual All\r\n\r\nLast month ABC premiered its new Sex and the City ish show Cashmere Mafia, with Lucy Liu as Mia Mason, A high powered publishing executive in the big apple. Not since maggie Cho's All American Girl (besides ABC) Has an Asian American been featured as a main player. But All American Girl was criticized by some for applying stereotypes for laughs, And Cho and network executives argued over exactly the required formula of \"asiatische ness, After a comprehensive debacle, Cho spiraled into various varieties of self destructiveness, And the show was terminated after one season. (think Lost, emergeny room, Grey's composition, characters, Entourage, Gilmore kids, for example.). Exposure is great, But Asian Americans typically are still relegated to ancillary roles.\r\n\r\nwearing Cashmere Mafia, Mia isn't immediately recognizable as the protagonist via voiceovers a la Carrie Bradshaw, But she's approach the leader of her pack. And Liu has first invoicing (Plus the most star power out from the cast).\r\n\r\nAnd the show neglects to ignore Liu's Asian ness. In web pages episode, Mia mom sets her up with a fabulous Chinese brain surgeon, jer (played by Jack Yang) But the date ends because awkward handshake. Jason later tells Mia that he doesn generally,often times date Chinese women. She confesses that she doesn date chinese language language men, possibly, when they both laugh. The connection isn preachy, Just a nod that yes, People do have biases especially alternatives dating.\r\n\r\nAnother useful moment: In the modern episode, Mia and the mind surgeon exchange a few words in Chinese (nearly ad libbed by the two actors). Cut to Mia cohort of stiletto stalking close friends gossiping (In native english speakers) relevant to her new man. Soon we're forgetting [url=http://www.chnlovereview.com/tips-on-chasing-chinese-girls-on-chnlove/]chinese datings[/url] about the Chinese and getting caught up in all of those other scene.\r\n\r\nWhen you are looking at diversifying prime time, This half motivated, Half silly show has good idea: We don't need high stereotypes; We just need to see cultural differences, And then get used to them. I getting tuned if not to see how this trend plays out, Then merely because the show is one of my guilty pleasures."
