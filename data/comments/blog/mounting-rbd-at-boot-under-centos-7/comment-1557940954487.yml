body: "Greetings, \r\n\r\nMy name is Jim, I work as a Business Consultant, and was doing research for another client when I came across your site bryanapperson.com. and thought I would message you on your contact form. \r\n\r\nAfter doing a quick analysis of your website, I noticed a couple of issues that are most likely causing people to leave without making contact.  I really liked your website but noticed you weren't getting a lot of traffic to your site and your googla ranking wasn't as strong as it could be.\r\n\r\nhttps://SEOGradeCheck.com\r\n\r\nI can run a SEO audit of your site and give you a call to go over the results for only $9.95.\r\n  \r\nBefore you waste hundreds or even thousands of dollars on advertising give me the opportunity to show you the issues that are keeping you from getting more visitors to your site.\r\nIf you'd like to talk personally please give me a call at 480-331-6775 9 to 5 MST USA.\r\n \r\nBest Regards,\r\nJames\r\nhttps://SEOGradeCheck.com\r\nsupport@SEOGradeCheck.com"
