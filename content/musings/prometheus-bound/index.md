The scene opens; Prometheus, the fore thinking one, has defied Zeus in giving
various knowledge to mankind, thus incurring his wrath. Hephaestus is nailing
Prometheus to a craggy mountain face reluctantly, spurred on by Might and
Violence. The immediate parallels with the fall of Man present themselves in the
modern context. The imagery is inverted, with the rebel suffering at the hands
of a tyrannical ruler of the universe for helping mankind. Prometheus is a
fire bringer, one who illuminates. He claims to have liberated man from
ignorance. Is man really better off with reason, conciousness and knowledge?

Whether or not man is better off for what Prometheus has done, Prometheus is
blessed with the gift of foresight. He knew beforehand the volume of his
suffering and how it would come to an end. He still made the choice to ease the
suffering of mankind, at his own expense. Prometheus has no fear of death, and
has taken the foresight of death away from mankind, freeing them to explore
knowledge, spurred by the ephemeral nature of mortal existence.

Zeus is presented in the dialectic of the characters as a young tyrant, eager to
make an example of those who would defy him. This is what has lead to the
overzealous punishment of Prometheus, doomed to have his liver eaten daily and
never die. This viewpoint of Zeus as arbitrary, capricious and tyrannical is
also present in other works of this time period. Aeschylus seems to be solidly
on the side of Prometheus in his writing. While Prometheus' actions are seen as
a sin by Zeus, they are not in the general story. In furtherance of this, we see
the suffering of Io, who is the matrilineal ancestor of Heracles. Prometheus
tells her how to end her torture at the hands of Zeus, for his own long term
benefit.

Can Might exist without Violence? Does Zeus need to act the tyrant to maintain
power? Does Might exist without Force behind it in our world today? Was what
Prometheus did a Sin? In some ways we are left with more questions then answers,
a lot to chew on.

Prometheus Bound is the central play and remainder of a trilogy written by
Aeschylus about the being who created mankind. Although the other plays are
largely lost to us, we learn that he was bound for thirty thousand years in the
surviving fragments of _The Firecarrier_. We also know that he was later freed
by Heracles in _Prometheus Unbound_. Zeus allows this in exchange for Prometheus
revealing the prophecy of Zeus' possible downfall in lying with Thetis, whereby
a son stronger than the father would be born. The redirection of this threat
leads to the birth of [Achilles](/musings/the-iliad/).

Reading the play and thinking about how you would direct it, or seeing it live
is likely best. In lieu of that, here is the best online production of the play
I could find:
