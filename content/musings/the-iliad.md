_The Iliad_ is a brutal war epic, perhaps _the_ war epic. I started reading it back in August of 2019. During the reading, I attended two seminars to discuss the book, and completed it in November. It was a hard read for me. That may have been because of the constant, grinding, unreal level of violence portrayed.

Though this was my first reading of _The Iliad_, I will hazard a summary to crystalize my understanding.

_The Iliad_ is the story of the **rage of Achilles**. On August 1st of 2019, I began reading the epic poem, written some 2800 years ago. This book is the starting point of my journey through the canon of the West, so to speak. This long journey started with a short walk, down to a [local bookstore](https://logosbookstorenyc.com/). The store, named Logos, seemed a fitting place to purchase my paperback copy of the Robert Fagles translation.
