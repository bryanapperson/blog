As the first play of The Orestia opens, the Trojan war is ending. The watchman,
straggling the Atreidae's roof dogwise, sees the beacon signaling victory in
Ilium. Agamemnon returns home with Cassandra, a prophetess and daughter of
Priam, as a concubine.  He has been gone for ten years, with the human sacrifice
of his daughter Iphigenia as his farewell. Once home he is greeted by the
duplicitous Clytaemestra. She conspires with her lover Aegisthus to kill
Agamemnon and seize the reins of power.  The plot thickens knowing, from what
the chorus has told the audience, that Agamemnon's father served Aegisthus'
father, his brother, his own children for dinner. This play is the
quintessential family blood feud.

## The Watchman

{{< blockquote cite="Watchman, Agamemnon L36" text="I speak for those who understand, but if they fail, I have forgotten everything." />}}

The Watchman, weary from his long service upon spotting the beacon speaks from
atop the house. His location creates the illusion of the house of Atreus, or the
nobility, speaking directly to the Chorus. He bemoans the time he has been
waiting and subtly hints at the misrule of "a lady's male strength of heart" and
because of it he feels moved to "weep again the pity of this house no longer, as
once, administered in the grand way". This subtlety indicates his dependence on
the rulers. His monologue indicates that he is on the side of
the people against the aristocracy, should they have success, in an attempt to
straddle the good graces of both sides.

## The Chorus

{{< blockquote cite="Antistrophe C, Agamemnon L755" text="From high good fortune in the blood blossoms the quenchless agony." />}}

The Chorus, who represent the people, play a passive role in Agamemnon. The
represent the [common man](/musings/the-odyssey#eumaeus). They
tell the audience the background story of the House of Atreus and it's curse.
They tell of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, at the outset 
of the Trojan war. They hint at a mistrust of Clytaemestra in the beginning.
After the murder of Agamemnon they examine Clytaemestra and Aegisthus, the guilt
of whom is apparent. They fault Aegisthus for the cowardly act of letting his
lover kill his enemy in surprise, rather then facing him directly. Throughout
the Chorus acts as an interrogative force and the conscience of the audience. 
Though the chorus sees the injustices, they are not empowered to act and 
allow the tyrants to "soil justice, while the power is [theirs]".

## Clytaemestra

{{< blockquote cite="Clytaemestra, Agamemnon L 1430" text="By my child's Justice driven to fulfillment, by her Wrath and Fury, to whom I sacrificed this man" />}}

{{< figure src="images/clytaemestra-kills-agamemnon.jpg" alt="Clytaemestra and Aegisthus prepare to kill Agamemnon." attrlink="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pierre-Narcisse_Gu%C3%A9rin_-_Clytemnestra_and_Agamemnon_-_WGA10974.jpg" >}}


Clytaemestra is unfaithful, but can we fault her? Her husband murdered
his own child for luck in a meaningless war. His nature and the brutal legacy of
his father made it easy to recruit enemies against him. If he had not sacrificed
their child in pursuit of a frivolous war, might she have remained true? Was she
wrong to plot his demise? What suffering should a person accept from a spouse?
Her revenge for her child may have been justified, but lead to the deposition of
her son Orestes, long absent, and the utter betrayal of her household. Her
primary crime in the eyes of the ancients may have been hinted at in his speech
about the "lady's male strength of heart" in crossing traditional gender role
boundaries. She is neither Helen, nor [Penelope](/musings/the-odyssey/#penelope), 
but does that make her wrong?

## The Herald

The Herald announces the return of the pythian, or Apollo blessed, king. This is
an appeal so that Apollo may show mercy on the Argives, now that the war has
ended. An interchange occurs with the Chorus, where the Chorus Leader makes it
apparent that the people have been oppressed under Clytaemestra's rule. The
interchange ends with the good news that the war in fact has ended.
Clytaemestra's tyranny and lies are seen to possibly be at an end. Unfortunately
this hope remains unfulfilled.  The herald further recalls the ruin of the
Argive fleet, cementing the possibility of a coup.

## Agamemnon

{{< blockquote cite="Agamemnon, Agamemnon L 830" text="In few men is it part of nature to respect a friend's prosperity withou begruding him, as envy's wicket poison settling to the heart piles up the pain in one sick with unhappiness, who, staggered under sufferings that are all this own, winces again to the vision of a neighbor's bliss." />}}

Agamemnon returns home victorious, though he suspects that the body politic may
have turned gangrenous. The people inform him that, though his crusade was ill
recieved, in victory the war for Helen has become palatable. On his arrival he
trusts his home to be secure in the hands of Clytaemestra. She twists him into
committing pride and idolatry of self by entering the palace walking on a red
tapestry, literature's first red carpet. Ironically his role in his namesake
play is limited and instead he is more of a backdrop character, killed soon
after arrival by his wife.

## Cassandra

{{< blockquote cite="Cassandra, Agamemnon L 1180" text="And drugged to double fury on the wine of men's blood shed there lurks forever here a drunken rout of ingrown vengeful spirits never to be cast forth." />}}

Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, arrives in Argos as Agamemnon's concubine. She
is a prophetess, or oracle of Apollo. She prophecies of the death of Agamemnon
at the hands of his wife, of her own death, and of the revenge which would
befall Clytaemestra. She speaks truly of the vicious cycle of death which is the
curse of the House of Atreus. Through her the audience learns of the coming
retribution from the one who would kill his own mother. Shortly after revealing
this, she dies at the hands of Clytaemestra without a threnoad.

## Aegisthus

Aegisthus is legitimately grieved; why not seize the opportunity which presents
itself? Revenge, a throne, even a queen are up for grabs. He has all the motive 
and no reason not to indulge it. Once he gains the throne he quickly shows 
himself to be the tyrant [Antinous](/musings/the-odyssey/#antinous) 
would have become. While this may be a tragic outcome for Agamemnon, presented
by the playwright as the returning hero, I cannot say that Aegisthus' actions
were unjustifed. Just or unjust, the perpetuate the cycle of violence which 
plagues the house of Atreus, and the people suffer for it.

## Takeaways

The House of Atreus the archtypical family fued. There is more to it than that
though. It symbolizes the need for an impartial system of justice and the
corruption that inherently occurs in powerful families. The common man sees the
injustice here, but is not able to stop it. The cycle of violence continues,
draining the land of it's lifeblood. Where will it stop, what levels of
depravity will be reached in it's escalation?
