The Orestia is a trilogy of greek tradgedies. I have plans to read the actual
plays in the future, but as of now have only watched them.

## Watching The Orestia

The 1983 rendition of The Orestia by Peter Hall for the BBC National Theatre
is just about the best version I could find. A kind soul had cleaned up the
audio, video and added subtitles. We all sat down and watched these high
energy reenactments over 3 nights.
