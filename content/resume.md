## Why I Want to Join Your Team

Being an asset to my team and providing value are my primary motivators. Automation, continuous delivery and cloud native design are at the forefront of my skill set. My interests are in distributed systems reliability, storage and compute technologies. I am a self educated engineer, a self-starter and a go-getter. I enjoy being part of a vibrant team of ruckus makers where I can learn from, as well as mentor others, while building reliable infrastructure.
