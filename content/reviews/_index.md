Over the past few days I have become interested in reading the great books of Western Civilization. This interest started after considering at length the public school system in the United States. Both in regards to my mixed experiences with it and in planning for my children's educations. I have always been an avid reader. However I haven't read many of, or studied at great depth, the foundational works of the West. In my research I stumbled upon [Susan Wise Bauer](https://susanwisebauer.com/), and [Online Great Books](https://onlinegreatbooks.com/) via the [Art of Manliness Podcast](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/great-conversation-the-great-books/).

I ended up purchasing Susan's books around childhood education to consider. In addition I began to peruse her Well Educated Mind guide to a classical education for an adult. I am a self educated engineer. I have not rounded out my education in the broader humanities. This resulted in a plan, to traverse a subset of the great works in chronological order. I will be starting with the Epic of Gilgamesh, then on to Homer. This project will take many years. I will use this as a place to keep a record of that and publish my musings on the works.
