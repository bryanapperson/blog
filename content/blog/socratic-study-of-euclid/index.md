Studying _The Elements of Euclid_ reveals the foundations of mathematical rigour
and the systems through the lens of which we see the world today. Though the end
result of the concepts covered in many of the books of the Elements will be
familiar to those who have completed high school maths; seeing Euclid's system
come together to weave the fabric of maths and understanding the proofs from
first principles is another matter entirely. When I started my, what will likely
be decades long, [study of the great books](/blog/a-study-of-the-great-books/) a
few months ago Euclid was on the list. I started study of Euclid by myself, but
was fortunate enough to be able to engage in a seminar based study of book 1
with [Online Great Books](https://onlinegreatbooks.com/).

Approaching rigorous, proof based mathematics from millennia past might seem
like a daunting task to some. It actually could not be further from daunting; it
is thrilling. When examined with wonder, discoveries abound.  The study of
spacial relation that is geometry is the most natural math for the human maid to
apprehend, and is a unique type of gymnastics for the mind. Plato required
mastery of geometry before entry the academy. It's at the heart of the physical
sciences, at the center of logic. This system remained unaltered for millennia,
and to this day still mostly does, excluding the discovery of curved space.

The first step to a study of Euclid is to take a look over the proofs and draw
them out on paper. Draw them by hand with nothing but a pencil, straight edge
and dividers; use color! Use the previous proofs to produce the later ones,
throw away your ruler and dive into the continuum without discrete measurement.
The elegance is stunning; every proof is used, no thought is wasted. From a
point, described as that which has no parts, Euclid's system builds to
geometries which can be used to describe the universe we inhabit, along with an
entirely abstract continuum which exists only in the mind.

Euclid, like most things, is best understood with fellow travelers. While
solitary study will yield understanding, the eye of the other is the best tool
with which to refine our apprehension. Using the format of Socratic seminars to
study Euclid allows for joint inquiry, and for me helped illuminate the
substance of Euclidean geometries as the soil that allowed modernity to bloom.
Once you've drawn out the proofs and thought about them, it is amazing to see
the variety approaches and connections other folks in seminar bring to the
table.

Having others to discuss these concepts with is the key to getting both a deeper
understanding and a calibration of how to approach the material. So to sum it
up, pencil, paper, dividers, straightedge, fellow travelers; put all this in the
format of a Socratic seminar, and you've got the elements for an elucidating
study of _The Elements_.
