Decentralized finance is changing the world of lending, borrowing, swapping 
assets, investing, insurance, and more. This is all happening in a trustless
fashion via smart contracts, primarly on the Ethereum blockchain. When I 
realized this, perhaps a bit late, in January of 2021; I became borderline 
obsessed. For the first time ever, regular people can act as their own 
banks, lending out money, swapping assets directly with counterparties, 
providing or purchasing insurance coverage and other derivatives. That's only 
the beginning. Art markets are emerging, corporate governance is happening on 
chain, real estate  and auto markets are likely soon to follow. This is 
the internet in 1997. Fortunes are being made and destroyed daily in a wild 
west where emergent developments outpace the understanding of anybody 
without an ear to the ground 24/7.

Bitcoin is just an asset store, but DeFi has the potential to eat most of 
traditional centralized finance and insurance. What is stopping it, for now, 
as the title of this article belies, is network congestion caused by limiting
architecture and frontrunning. Those problems are being solved, and are the 
only thing which, in my opinion, put a hamper on the parabolic growth of 
DeFi between August of 2020 and February of 2021.

## The Characters of Decentralized Finance

DeFi on Ethereum is composed of miners, searchers, builders, users and 
speculators. Miners validate the transactions and blocks which comprise the 
blockchain. Searchers act like DevOps for DeFi protocols providing 
arbitrage to automated market makers, liquidations to lending and borrowing 
protocols, as well as price oracle updates. Builders create the protocols, 
often riffing on other protocols and using them as building blocks for novel 
financial instruments. Users use protocols for many purposes outlined above.
Speculators buy and hold various assets to speculate on future value.

I approached DeFi, at first, as a user. I was intrigued by the idea of 
lending stablecoins out for APYs one thousand times greater than those 
offered by centralized finance institutions. What are stablecoins you ask? 
Stablecoins are crypto assets designed to have a stable value, sometimes 
with a hard or soft peg to a fiat currency, or physical commodity like 
gold. Then I became interesting in speculating on governance tokens.
I acquired art on chain, bought insurance for the Compound protocol where 
I was lending out Dai, a soft pegged USD stablecoin, for interest. I ran 
some 465 transactions over the course of a few months, with gas fees 
totalling enough to buy a decent used car. What I figured out, primarily, 
is that DeFi is going places, and that users, builders, searchers and 
miners are creating a whole new ecosystem that is definitely worth getting 
involved with. Also, that price speculation and swinging in and out of 
crypto assets is for the birds.

## Learning about DeFi

The best way to learn about DeFi is to join the community Discord chats, ask 
questions. Get a hardware wallet, learn how to use it. Setup Metamask, 
play around on a test network, so you don't spend a used car in gas. This 
trustless world of DeFi is just getting started, and it's a playground 
for developers. Builders and searchers are in demand, and the opportunity 
there for the technically inclined is, I believe, leviathan.

## My Favorite Ethereum DeFi Protocols

Uniswap, Compound, Nexus Mutual, Chainlink, The Graph; these are the projects 
which intrigue me most at present. Layer 2, the solution to the expense 
holding back the growth of DeFi, is expanding. Layer 2 with rapid and 
inexpensive connectivity between L2 protocols and better fiat on and off ramps
will take DeFi mainstream in the next 2 years. Self custodial debit cards 
like Monolith will almost entirely obviate the need for bank accounts once 
combined with fiat payment systems like Venmo and Zelle.

## What Are We Waiting For?

What are you going to build? Why aren't you earning 35% on your USD pegged 
savings? These are the questions which become immediately apparent when 
you start to dig into DeFi. For now, the answer might be transaction fees, 
but it won't be forever.
