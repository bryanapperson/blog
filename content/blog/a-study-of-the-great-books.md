In August of 2019 I became interested in reading the great books of Western Civilization. This interest started whilst considering at length the public school system in the United States. Both in regards to my mixed experiences with it, and in planning for my children’s educations. I have always been an avid reader. However I haven’t read many of, or studied in great depth, the foundational works of the West. In my research I stumbled upon [Online Great Books](https://onlinegreatbooks.com/) via the [Art of Manliness Podcast](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/great-conversation-the-great-books/).

This started me on a journey of reading deeply into the western canon as outlined in How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler. This series contains my musings on the works as I read them and my eventualy contain important resources and study methods.
