On a Saturday evening last August my other half and I and left the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a taxi bound for JFK. Excitement and apprehension were in the air as we were eager to leave, but about to commend our kids to my mother in law for a week. We had, and have not since, been away for so long from our children. After arriving, we were informed that we were *extremely* early. Stuck in the purgatory of the waiting area outside the terminal, we polished off of dinner in a nondescript diner, eagerly biding our time. After a period of time, we passed through security and boarded our red-eye to **Santa Marta** by way of Bogota.

## Arrival

Having gathered a little bit of sleep on the plane, we were in Santa Marta, and it was a glorious radiant morning. Into a taxi bound for Hotel Tayromar we went.  After a drive through this unfamiliar country and a conversation utilizing my rusty Spanish, we arrived. With the day free and our bags stowed at the hotel, fighting the need for sleep, we took to the streets. Cafe Ikaro was adjacent, thus it was the next logical stop for coffee and a bite to eat. We snapped some excellent photos following an afternoon rainstorm.

When we roused from an early evening nap, a steak and _ceviche_ dinner followed. We had introductions and some time to get familiar with the group who would enter our lives for the next five days. After conversing with our guides and fellow travelers, we turned in, prepared for the journey ahead.

## Day 1

At dawn our group hopped into two all wheel drive vehicles. The beginning of a one and a half hour winding ride up into the foothills of *la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta*. Breakfast was served in a village by the name of Machete Pelao. One of our guides explained the namesake, people there invariably had to maintain a machete at the ready. The great food and better hospitality after the Colombian fashion set us up for a good day of walking.

Once breakfast had settled drove a bit further, lurching to a halt at the trail-head. **The pavement ended.** The dust from our rides driving away cemented the finality of the fact that we would devote the next five days to being afoot. The beginning of the day was invested walking on a dirt road that was mixed use, though the lone vehicles we observed were motorcycles. The road wound up farther into the mountains, through cattle pasture and coffee fields that had until perhaps a decade ago been under cultivation for cocaine and cannabis. The conversion to coffee, cattle and tourism represented a turn for the better. During the midday heat we stopped to have a break at a roadside refreshment stand and I observed the first local arachnid of the trip.

Our path continued, traversing a few more miles in the sweltering heat of the exposed pasture. The relief was palpable when we reached the border of Wiwa and Kogi lands. This zone was under permacultural cultivation and the forest canopy was in tact. The perceived and effective temperature of the August sun in Colombia was much reduced. We started to pass creeks, rivers and springs unused for intensive agriculture. Our indigenous guide drank directly from the springs. Though our minds still felt a need to pass the water through chemical and mechanical purification, perhaps out of fear of the unknown. We had a few stops along the way to eat succulent fruits, which helped me immensely.

Towards the waning of the day, we began passing by Kogi settlements. Most of the tribe still lives in the traditional fashion. It was explained to us that the elect and the Mamos are the solitary ones burdened by interacting with the external world. Utilizing unnatural or composite materials to deliver opportunity to the community and export their ideas. We got a glimpse into a reflection what life in precolonial Colombia might have been like. At this point there were no more motorcycles or cars, all transit was powered by human or mule.

Some time later once the hinterlands of dusk were playing upon the sky, we struck Wiwa camp, our home for the night. There was a natural pool in the Buritaca River nearby, and we all experienced a much needed dip in the cool mountain waters. Once we had devoured a hearty dinner prepared by our trail chef we heard stories and myths regaled by our Wiwa guide and translated to us in English by our jovial Colombian guide. After listening to the tales and enjoying a cold beer, it was time to turn in. At camp beds and hammocks were provided. However, my wife and had brought our own two person hammock, that would prove a sensible choice. We suspended it and slept like the dead.

## Day 2

The morning arrived with stiffness present. We had mistakenly packed more then needed, being used to unsupported hikes. We shook down our packs and took down our shelter. We took the opportunity to drop off many bits of unneeded gear in a lockup at this camp, to come back for it in a few days. Feeling heartened by a lighter load and a solid breakfast we embraced the day.

There was an optional trip to a nearby waterfall which a subset of the group, us included, partook of.  We all swam, which at least for me helped soothe the ache of my neophyte trail legs. Then our guide suggested standing under the waterfall, which I withstood the full fury of, a backcountry massage. After some relaxation we left to reunite with the remnant who had remained at camp and resume our journey. On the way out we had the privilege of observing a traditional greeting ritual.

After that we hit the trail for a shorter day by mileage, but harder in terms of elevation change and terrain. After some time following the river, we had an opportunity to take a swim. The next leg of the journey was described to the group as two hours up, one hour down and two hours up. Given that, we all decided to stop and swim. Afterwards we resumed our journey and went uphill. Then we kept going uphill.
