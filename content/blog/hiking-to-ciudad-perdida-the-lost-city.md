Over last summer my other half and I had a rare opportunity to go on a vacation without our kids. My mother in law was coming to visit and offered to watch them for a week. Neither of us had ever been to South America, and wanted to do something that would be hard to do with young ones in tow. Given this, we took an adventurous vacation to the Santa Marta region of Columbia for a trek to *Ciudad Perdida* (a.k.a the Lost City, actually called Teyuna by the locals). We booked the through [GAdventures](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/colombia-lost-city-trekking/), which I was very pleased with.

Our flight left out of JFK by way of Bogata, unfortunately we did not have a chance leave the airport in Bogata. Upon arrival in Santa Marta we toured the city a bit and had dinner out with the group we would hike with, as a meet n' greet. The historical district of Santa Marta is really charming. We had a chance to spend a full day there on the return end of the trip and get out to experience the nightlife as well.

The next morning our group of 12, inclusive of the 2 guides, hopped into 4x4 vehicles for a 1.5 hour drive up into *la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta*. Breakfast was served in a village called Machete Pelao. One of our guides explained the namesake was for the fact that people there always had to have a machete at the ready. The food and hospitality was awesome and set us up for a good day of walking. 

After breakfast there was a short drive, then we were at the trailhead. **The pavement ended.** The beginning of the day was spent walking on a dirt road that was mixed use, though the only vehicles we saw regularly were motorcycles. The road wound up further into the mountains, through cattle pasture that had until recently been under cultivation for cocaine and cannabis. During the midday heat we stopped to have a break and I saw the first local arachnid of the trip.
