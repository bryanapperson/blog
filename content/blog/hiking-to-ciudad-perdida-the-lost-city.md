## Departing

On a Saturday evening last August my other half and I and left the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a taxi bound for JFK. Excitement and apprehension were in the air as we were eager to leave, but about to entrust our kids to my mother in law for a week. We had, and have not since, been away for so long from our children. After arriving, we were informed that we were extremely early. Stuck in the purgatory of the waiting area outside the terminal, we partook of dinner in a nondescript diner, eagerly biding our time. After a period of time, we passed through security and boarded our red-eye to Santa Marta by way of Bogota.

## Day 1

Having gathered a little bit of sleep on the plane, we were in Santa Marta, and it was a glorious radiant morning. Into a taxi bound for Hotel Tayromar we went. After a drive through this unfamiliar country and a conversation utilizing my rusty Spanish, we arrived. With the day free and our bags stowed at the hotel, fighting the need for sleep, we took to the streets. Cafe Ikaro was adjacent and the next logical stop for coffee and a bite to eat. Santa Marta as it turned out, is a photogenic city. We snapped some excellent photos following an afternoon rainstorm.

When we awoke from an early evening nap, a steak and _ceviche_ dinner ensued. We had introductions and some time to get familiar with the group who would enter our lives for the next five days. After conversing with our guides and fellow travelers, we turned in, prepared for the journey ahead.

## Day 2

At dawn our group hopped into two all wheel drive vehicles. The beginning of a one and a half hour winding ride up into the foothills of _la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta_. Breakfast was served in a village by the name of Machete Pelao. One of our guides explained the namesake, people there invariably had to maintain a machete at the ready. The food and hospitality after the Colombian fashion set us up for a good day of walking.

Once breakfast had settled drove a bit further, lurching to a halt at the trail-head. **The pavement ended.** The dust from our rides driving away cemented the finality of the fact that we would devote the next five days to being afoot. The beginning of the day was invested walking on a dirt road that was mixed use, though the lone vehicles we observed were motorcycles. The road wound up farther into the mountains, through cattle pasture and coffee fields that had until perhaps a decade ago been under cultivation for cocaine and cannabis. The conversion to coffee, cattle and tourism represented a turn for the better. During the midday heat we stopped to have a break at a roadside beverage stand and I observed the first local arachnid of the trip.

Our path continued, traversing a few more miles in the sweltering heat of the exposed pasture. The relief was palpable when we reached the border of Wiwa and Kogi lands. This zone was under a kind of pastoral permaculture cultivation and the forest canopy was in tact. The perceived and effective temperature of the August sun in Colombia was much reduced. We started to pass creeks, rivers and springs unused for intensive agriculture. Our indigenous guide drank directly from the springs. Though our minds still felt a need to pass the water through chemical and mechanical purification, perhaps out of fear of the unknown.

At the tail end of the day we began passing by Kogi settlements. Most of the tribe still lives in the traditional fashion. It was explained to us that the elect and the Mamos are the solitary ones burdened by interacting with the external world. Utilizing unnatural or composite materials to deliver opportunity to the community and export their ideas. We got a glimpse into a reflection what life in pre-colombian Colombia might have been like. At this point there were no more motorcyles or cars, all transit was powered by human or mule.

Some time later once the hinterlands of dusk were playing upon the sky, we struck Wiwa camp, our home for the night. Beds and hammocks were provided. However, we had brought our own. Once we had consumed a hearty dinner prepared by our trail chef, we suspended it and slept like the dead.
