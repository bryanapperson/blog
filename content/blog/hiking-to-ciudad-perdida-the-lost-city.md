Over last summer my other half and I had a rare opportunity to go on a vacation without our kids. My mother in law was coming to visit and offered to watch them for a week. Neither of us had ever been to South America, and wanted to do something which would be hard to do with young ones in tow. Given this, we took an adventurous vacation to the Santa Marta region of Columbia for a trek to _Ciudad Perdida_ (a.k.a the _Teyuna_ by the locals). This is our story.

## Departing

Late on a Saturday evening we left the Upper East Side of Manhattan in a taxi bound for JFK. After arriving excessively early the Avianca agent notified us that we could not go through security into the terminal until 3 hours before the flight. Stuck in the purgatory of the waiting area outside the terminal, we ate dinner an a nondescript diner, eagerly biding our time. Eventually we went through security and boarded our red-eye to Santa Marta by way of Bogota.

## Day 1

After getting a little bit of sleep on the plane, we were in Santa Marta, and it was a beautiful sunny morning. With the day free we decided to stay awake and walked the city streets. Santa Marta is a photogenic city, and we snapped some good photos post-ceding an afternoon rainstorm. In the evening a steak and _ceviche_ dinner ensued. This provided a good opportunity to get familiar with the group who would enter our lives for the next 5 days.

## Day 2

The next morning our group of 12, inclusive of the 2 guides, hopped into 4x4 vehicles for a 1.5 hour drive up into _la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta_. Breakfast was served in a village called Machete Pelao. One of our guides explained the namesake was for the fact that people there always had to have a machete at the ready. The food and hospitality was awesome and set us up for a good day of walking.

After breakfast there was a short drive, then we were at the trail-head. **The pavement ended.** The beginning of the day was spent walking on a dirt road that was mixed use, though the only vehicles we saw regularly were motorcycles. The road wound up further into the mountains, through cattle pasture that had until recently been under cultivation for cocaine and cannabis. During the midday heat we stopped to have a break at a roadside beverage stand and I saw the first local arachnid of the trip.
