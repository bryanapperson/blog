				BitronicTech is now offering a free domain and hosting when you buy 1 year of web hosting. Here at BitronicTech we are making some <a title="Unlimited SSD Space" href="https://www.bitronictech.net/announcements/125/Bitronic-Technologies-to-Offer-Unlimited-SSD-Web-Hosting.html">improvements</a> to our shared hosting stack. One thing that will continue is the deal we have always had for a free domain name with hosting for 1 year at only $69.99. What we will also be giving you is: unlimited space, bandwidth and up to 10 websites for one low price. Getting a free domain and hosting with cPanel will be easier than ever.

BitronicTech hosting will also be making the move to use SSD RAID10, yielding IO speeds up to 1.1GBPS. This will be a revolutionary improvement to our shared hosting which already includes cPanel, Varnish, CloudFlare, <a title="Softaculous" href="http://www.softaculous.com/">Softaculous</a> and much more. The new SSD hosting plans will replace the old ones on February 1st. Existing customers have the option to switch or remain with their present plans, as mentioned in the last article.

Starting February 1st, getting a free domain and hosting made for you will be easier than ever. Things are going well in our new data center. The move over to in-house infrastructure has allowed us to make serious performance gains while still keeping the price very affordable. Unlimited SSD hosting hosted on enterprise grade server with tuned and manged software stack for only $6.99 per month is a great deal. Add in the fact that it's only $69.99 per year for a free domain and hosting, you can't go wrong. Look out for our latest deals and updates here in the announcements section. You can see all of our shared hosting options <a title="Web Hosting" href="https://www.bitronictech.net/web-hosting.php">here</a>.

Varnish cache, PHP-FCGI, CloudLinux, MariaDB 10.0 and many other pieces of great software set our hosting stack apart from the rest. Add SSD RAID10 and this will be some of the fastest hosting around. Once we launch the new service we will be posting benchmarks to compare our present hosting stack against the one we are now releasing. We'll also do some load speed tests against other hosts and see who fares better.
