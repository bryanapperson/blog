## Migrating to Hugo

It is 2019, enter the brave new world of serverless computing and static blogging. After years of using WordPress, and a few years without any updates this blog is in need of a refresh. When I originally created this blog I had servers (a whole web hosting company in fact). Now I just want to be able to create content and have a lightning fast website that is easy to maintain.

Earlier today I was doing some research, came across Hugo and decided to rebuild this blog using it and host it using github pages, at least initially. This site will likely be a work in progress for some time, however at least the text of the old content is migrated now. As I do this migration I will put out a series of articles on the how and the why of the migration.

## Why Hugo?

Hugo is lightning fast at rendering pages and simple to use, plus the workflow with github pages is straightforward.
