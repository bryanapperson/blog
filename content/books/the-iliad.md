*The Iliad* is the story of the **rage of Achilles**. On August 1st of 2019, I began reading the epic poem, written some 2800 years ago. This book is the starting point of my journey through the canon of the West, so to speak. This long journey started with a short walk, down to a [local bookstore](https://logosbookstorenyc.com/). The store, named Logos, seemed a fitting place to purchase my paperback copy of the Robert Fagles translation.
